This is the repository for the `ordbetareg` package, which can be used to fit the ordered beta regression model as specified in Kubinec (2022) (see paper https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2sx6y/). This package will soon be on CRAN, but to use the current version, use this install command (requires the `remotes` package to be installed first):

```
remotes::install_github("saudiwin/ordbetaregpack",build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

You can read about the package in the introduction vignette by using the `vignette("package_introduction", package="ordbetareg")` command at the R console.
